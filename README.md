# visual_explanation_methods_eval

This repository contains several python notebooks, used evaluate Grad-CAM, Score-CAM, Faster-Score-CAM, Saliency Maps and Smooth Grad implemented with tf-keras-vis.

There are two notebooks in which each a model (one ResNet-based and one Xception-based) is created and trained on UCF-50.
